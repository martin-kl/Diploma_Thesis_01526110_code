/**
 * A class for driving the execution of transactions against a remote Neo4j
 * server over the Neo4j REST API. An application uses the driver by queuing a
 * sequence of statements in the driver, then calling methods to execute those
 * statements in different ways.
 * <p>
 * In addition to supporting typical interactive style transactions where the
 * application executes statements and views results in a loop before
 * ultimately deciding to commit or rollback, the driver also supports "blind"
 * transactions where the application composes one or more statements and both
 * executes and commits in one request to the server. In certain simple
 * situations (for instance, adding a node to the graph) this can save a round
 * trip to the database and save latency.
 * <p>
 * Special Notes:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>This class is not thread-safe. Such thread-safety would have no benefit
 * since Neo4j (v2.3.3) does not support concurrent requests accessing the same
 * transaction.</li>
 * <li>The driver does not currently support authentication with the server.
 * Authentication must be turned off (see Neo4j documentation).</li>
 * <li>Open transactions on the Neo4j server are automatically rolled back
 * after a timeout period of inactivity. Be sure to adjust your timeout
 * configuration value to meet your application needs.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * TODO:<br>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Add functionality for asynchronous execution of queries (maybe something
 * like an execAsync and waitAsync method pair).</li>
 * <li>Add way for client to authenticate itself with the server over HTTP</li>
 * <li>Add way for client to authenticate itself with the server over
 * HTTPS</li>
 * <li>Add logging</li>
 * <li>Add exceptions</li>
 * <li>Remove duplicated code in exec, execAndCommit, and commit</li>
 * </ul>

   * //... do work<br>
   * driver.enqueue(s2, s3)<br>
   * results = driver.exec()<br>
   * // analyze results {s1: results[0], s2: results[1], s3: results[2]}<br>
   * // generate new statements<br>
   * driver.enqueue(s4, s5, s6)<br>
   * results = driver.exec()<br>
   * // analyze results<br>
   * // decide to commit (or rollback)<br>
   * driver.commit(); // or driver.rollback()<br>
   * </code> <br>
   * When interactive use is not needed, {@link #execAndCommit()} can be used
   * to execute statements and commit the transaction in one method call.
   *

   * ordering in the driver (that is, the nth result is for the nth enqueued
