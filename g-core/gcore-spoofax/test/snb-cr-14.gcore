/*
Given two Persons, find all (unweighted) shortest paths between these two Persons, 
in the subgraph induced by the Knows relationship. Then, for each path calculate 
a weight. The nodes in the path are Persons, and the weight of a path is the sum 
of weights between every pair of consecutive Person nodes in the path. The weight 
for a pair of Persons is calculated such that every reply (by one of the Persons) 
to a Post (by the other Person) contributes 1.0, and every reply (by ones of the 
Persons) to a Comment (by the other Person) contributes 0.5. Return all the paths 
with shortest length, and their weights.
